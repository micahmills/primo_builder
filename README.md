This repo contains the builder for Primo. If you're working on Primo, you'll need to clone both this and the main repo and link this one. Futher instructions coming soon.

This is a fork of https://github.com/primocms/builder so I can add languages to the language list. I will try to keep it up to date with the main repo.
